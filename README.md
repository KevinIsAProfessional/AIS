# AIS
Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) habitat suitability prediction toolset

---

## Dependencies
You will need access to a Google Earth Engine account in order to use this package.
In addidtion, the following packages are required:
* python 3
* earthengine-api 
* pandas
* geopandas
* numpy

---

## Setup 
#### Conda
It is recommended that you set up a conda environment prior to using this package.
If you choose not to, continue down to [Earthengine authentication](#earthengine-authentication). 
```
% conda create -n gee python=3
% source activate gee
% conda install -c conda-forge earthengine-api
% conda install -c anaconda pandas
% conda install -c anaconda geopandas
% conda install -c anaconda numpy
```

#### Earthengine authentication
Make sure you have access to an Earth Engine account and have installed Python earthengine-api. 
Run `earthengine authenticate` and follow the prompts.\
You should now have an environment variable set up an authentication key, which allows you to directly initialize ee without authenticating it every time.

## Workflow

###### Protip: GEE = Google Earth Engine

The two goals of this software are to produce a prediction visualization and produce a feature importance histogram.
In order to do both of these, we need a set of training data. In order to get training data, we need both covariate assets and AIS presence/absence data.\
With this in mind, the workflow is structured as follows:
1. Generate covariate assets in GEE
2. Spatially thin user supplied presence/absence data
3. Combine covariate assets and thinned presence/absence data to create training data files
4. Train and run a machine learning model that outputs a prediction visualization and a feature importance graphic


The following sections will walk you through running the pipeline from start to finish.
For this section, it is assumed that your environment is properly set up.

### Config: aisconfig.ini
* STATE: The US state that contains your presence/absence data points
* STATE_ABBREVIATION: The two letter abbreviation for your chosen state. e.g. Montana = MT
* START_YEAR: First year of interest range
* END_YEAR: Last year of interest range

* GEE_PATH: The GEE path to your Earth Engine user directory. Must end in a forward slash. e.g. `users/kjchristensen93/`
* AIS_POINT_PATH: The GEE path to your (unthinned) presence/absence asset. This is the path to an asset, not to a directory. It must NOT end in a forward slash.  
* AIS_THINNED_POINT_PATH: The GEE path to your thinned presence/absence asset. This is a path to an asset, not to a directory. It mush NOT end in a forward slash.
* ASSETID: GEE path to where the covariate files will be exported. This is a directory, it must end in a forward slash.

* TRAINING_DATA: Local directory to where your training files will be exported. 
* TESTING_DATA: Local path, including filename, to where `./testing_data.py` will export it's output file. e.g. `./datasets/training_data/<your-filename>.csv`
* VISUALIZATION_DATA: Local path, including filename, to where `./ml_script.py` will export it's output file. e.g. `./datasets/visualizations/<your-filename>.csv`
* HUC_STATE: Local path, including filename, of the .geojson file containing HUC data. (8/3/21) We will provide a .geojson for Montana.

NOTE: (8/3/21) Montana is the only state currently supported

#### Make Covariates: ./make_covariates.py
Required config variables:\
START_YEAR, END_YEAR, STATE, ASSETID

In order to create training data for the machine learning model, you will need annual covariate data assets stored in GEE.
Generating the covariate files takes a while (> 1 hour), but should only need to be done once per state. \
To generate a set of files, set variables in aisconfig.ini, then run `./make_covariates`.

NOTES:
* You should only use years for which you have data in your presence/absence datasets.
* (7/28/21) The only state currently supported is Montana.
* Your GEE paths will (at least should) always start with `/users/<gee_username>/`
* You can check the status of your covariate assets in the `tasks` tab in your GEE console.

#### Spatially Thin Data
I'll fill this in when I've finished the code

#### Make Training Data: ./training_data.py
Required config variables:\
START_YEAR, END_YEAR, STATE_ABBREVIATION, ASSETID, AIS_THINNED_POINT_PATH, TRAININGDATA

Training data files are .csv files that combine covariate data and presence/absence data. \
These files are used to train the Machine Learning model. They require GEE covariate assets for each year in your interest range,
and a GEE asset of thinned presence/absence data.\
When this step is done, you will have a collection of .csv files in the folder specified by TRAININGDATA in aisconfig.ini. The files are named `2002.csv`, `2003.csv`, etc for each year in your interest range.\
To generate training data, set variables in aisconfig.ini and run `./make_training_data.py`

NOTES:
* The program will overwrite any files in the given folder that share the name of the file being exported.
* If your presence/absence asset does not contain any points for a given year, it will display a warning and skip that year.
* (8/2/2021) The only state currently supported is Montana.

#### Make Testing Data: ./testing_data.py
Required config variables:\
START_YEAR, END_YEAR, STATE_ABBREVIATION, ASSETID, TESTING_DATA

Testing data files take the training data files and average the data over a range of years. \
Testing data files are used by a trained Machine Learning model to produce a prediction file. \
To generate testing data, set variables in aisconfig.ini and run `./testing_data.py`\
You may wish to create multiple testing files from ranges in your training data. To do this, you will need to manually edit START_YEAR, END_YEAR, and TESTING_DATA in aisconfig.ini and run the program multiple times.\
Note that if you don't edit TESTING_DATA, your testing data will be overwritten each time your run the program.


#### Machine Learning: ./ml_script.py
Required config variables: \
TRAINING_DATA, TESTING_DATA, VISUALIZATION_DATA, HUC_STATE

The machine learning portion takes a folder full of training data, a single testing data file, and a huc .geojson, and returns a prediction file in the form of a .csv.
The script also outputs a histogram of feature importances as determined by the ML model.
To run, set the variables in aisconfig.ini and run ./run_model.
If you have split your testing data into multiple files, you will have to run the model multiple times, changing TESTING_DATA and VISUALIZATION_DATA in aisconfig each time.
If you do not change VISUALIZATION_DATA, your prediction .csv will be overwritten each time you run the model.
